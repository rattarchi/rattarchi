Hello, I am Roy (Hassan) Attarchi. With a Ph.D. in Mathematics from the Georgia Institute of Technology, a minor degree in Statistics, and a robust background in academic research, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to the finance and tech industries, specifically in roles such as quantitative researcher or trader, applied scientist, or data scientist.

Currently, I am enhancing my coding skills in Python, R-Studio, and SQL, with a focus on machine learning, data visualization, and quantitative analysis. My present focus is on modeling and predicting chaotic systems using ML techniques.

In mathematics, a system is considered chaotic when the approximation of the present situation cannot predict the approximation of the future. I am interested in developing techniques to empower ML algorithms in predicting the future for chaotic systems. 

I am open to discussing new ideas in this field, and you can reach me at:
